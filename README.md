- 🔬 Hi, I’m Darrell Jenkins.
- 😃 **<span style="font-size: 14px; color: teal; front-weight: bold;">I’m interested in helping both Python and the Python Community thrive. To that goal, I am running for the PSF Board 2024! My video for candidacy is featured here:  (https://youtu.be/OWyunE7PD0I?si=ZF9g5_nRqbngi-6L).
And my written statement is here::(https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/)). Voting is from July 2 through July 16.</span>**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and loving every moment!
- 💞️ If you or someone you know is part of a small team (1 -5 devs) I would love to collaborate on anything Python related.
- 📫 Feel free to message me on LinkedIn:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellajenkins

- ⚡ Fun fact: I played in a Wheel of Fortune episode in October 2017!
